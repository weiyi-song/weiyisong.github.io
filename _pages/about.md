Chinese soprano Weiyi Song strives to integrate innovative, transformative storytelling to make classical vocal music more engaging and accessible, drawing inspiration from music’s profound ability to connect and heal. 

Weiyi’s artistry has taken her across continents and repertoires. Most recently, she returned to the Savannah VOICE Festival, where she sang Clorinda in the world premiere of Michael Ching’s Cinderella’s Royal Feast and created the role of Susie in Jodi Goble’s The Eleanors at the National Opera Association. With Carnegie Mellon Opera she gave a powerful portrayal of Anne Sexton in Conrad Susa’s Transformations and brought sparkle and charm to Musetta (La Bohème) and Lisette (La Rondine). With Pittsburgh Festival Opera she debuted as the Sandman and Dew Fairy in Hänsel and Gretel. 

As a concert soloist, Weiyi has appeared in the Savannah VOICE Festival’s Aria and Coffee Concerts, as well as in major events in China, including the IAF West Lake Animation Biennale Opening Concert, the One Poem, One Song, One World series, and the Meng Dong Ge Yue contemporary vocal works concert. She toured as a featured soloist in the Talented Student Concert Series across Zhejiang Province and performed in the ensemble of Adriana Lecouvreur with Pittsburgh Festival Opera. She appeared in Die Fledermaus and Die Zauberflöte at the Zhejiang Conservatory of Music.

Her stage experience extends beyond opera; she has collaborated as a guest artist in the China Academy of Art Works Exhibition and has been invited to host national music events, including the Golden Bell Awards, China’s largest vocal competition. In 2018, she was featured in the music video Look in Your Eyes, sung by renowned tenor Yijie Shi.

Her dedication has been recognized with honors such as First Prize in the National Chinese Classics Recitation Competition and the title of Outstanding Graduate of Zhejiang Province. Now expanding her training at Carnegie Mellon University, Weiyi often integrates Mandarin poetry recitation into her performances, drawing on her background in classical recitation to create work that is both musically compelling and culturally resonant. Through cross-cultural expression, she hopes to bring people closer together. To her, opera is not just performance but shared storytelling, a moment of exchange with the audience that opens space for feeling, reflection, and change.
